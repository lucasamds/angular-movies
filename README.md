# Angular Movies

This project was created with the intention of practicing Angular. Here i tried to simulate a website that list movies.

The project has three pages:
- Home page that shows the available movies
- Details page that shows the details of a specific movie
- Watchlist page that shows the movies on the user's watchlist

## Running the project

To run this project, it's necessary start the `json-server` first, so we can access the data needed. To do that, run `json-server --watch .\db.json`. By default, the server will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
